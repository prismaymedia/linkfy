## ‚ùì FAQ

### **Q: When will Apple Music support be available?**
A: Apple Music integration is planned for Q1 2026 as part of Version 3.0. We're currently working on API access and track matching algorithms.

### **Q: Will there be a mobile app?**
A: Native mobile apps are planned for Q1 2027. However, the current web application is fully mobile-responsive and works excellently on mobile browsers.

### **Q: Can I contribute to specific platform integrations?**
A: Absolutely! Platform integrations are a priority area for contributors. Check our [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on adding new platform support.

### **Q: Is there an API for developers?**
A: A public API is planned for Q4 2026. Currently, the API is internal-only, but we're working on documentation and access controls for external developers.

### **Q: How do you ensure user privacy?**
A: Privacy is a core principle. We don't store user data, all conversions are processed in real-time, and we're implementing additional privacy controls in Phase 2.

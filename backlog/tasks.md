## Notes for Task Integration

When integrating these tasks into the main roadmap:

1. **Minor Bug Fixes** → Can be added to any active sprint as polish items
2. **Documentation Tasks** → Should be prioritized with feature development
3. **Advanced Infrastructure** → Fits in Phase 4 (Enterprise) of the roadmap
4. **Code Quality** → Can be distributed across all phases as technical debt
5. **Future Enhancements** → Consider for post-v5.0 planning
6. **Advanced Testing** → Should accompany Phase 2 (Quality focus)

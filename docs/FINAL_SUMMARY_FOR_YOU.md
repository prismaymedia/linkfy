```
✅ ALL tasks preserved
✅ NOTHING deleted
✅ ONLY redistributed across Q4

Sprint 3-4: 52h Notion + 28h original = 80h ✓
Sprint 5-6: 40h overflow items + 40h new features = 80h ✓
Sprint 7-8: Performance & reliability = 76h (holiday adjusted)
Sprint 9: Music player = 68h (vacation adjusted)
Sprint 10: Polish & Q1 = 48h (holiday reduced)

TOTAL Q4 = 452 hours ✓
```

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment Changes

### Before Reorganization
| Sprint | Risk | Reason |
|--------|------|--------|
| 3-4 | MEDIUM | Backlog scattered |
| 5-6 | HIGH | Overcommitted |
| 7-8 | HIGH | Performance + overflow |
| 9 | MEDIUM | Vacation impact |
| 10 | HIGH | Low capacity |

### After Reorganization
| Sprint | Risk | Reason |
|--------|------|--------|
| 3-4 | 🟢 LOW | Full capacity, focused |
| 5-6 | 🟡 MEDIUM | 95% utilization, manageable |
| 7-8 | 🟡 MEDIUM | Performance optimized |
| 9 | 🟡 MEDIUM | Feature flags + buffer |
| 10 | 🔴 HIGH | 40h capacity (unavoidable) |

**Overall**: Risk reduced from HIGH (multiple sprints) → MANAGEABLE (isolated Sprint 10)

## 💡 Strategic Benefits

### ✅ Pros of Reorganization

1. **Backlog Focus** (50h in 2 sprints)
   - Users see Notion items completed
   - API modernization de-risks future features
   - Clear ROI for stakeholders

2. **Capacity Optimization**
   - Sprint 3-4 at 100% (GREEN ZONE) instead of 80%
   - 432h realistic (not 440h fantasy)
   - Holiday impact properly accounted for

3. **Quality Buffer**
   - Spread work more evenly
   - Sprint 3-4 success gives momentum
   - Less panic in December

4. **Stakeholder Alignment**
   - Notion backlog items visible + scheduled
   - Clear delivery dates (Nov 10, Nov 24)
   - Easier to communicate progress

### ⚠️ Potential Cons

1. **Sprint 10 Crunch** 🔴
   - Only 40 effective hours
   - Mitigation: Front-load critical work

2. **Less Flexibility**
   - Sprints 5-6, 7-8 at 95% utilization
   - Less room for surprises
   - Mitigation: Use feature flags, reduce scope if needed

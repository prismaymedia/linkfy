## 🎯 Quarter Overview (Updated)

| Sprint | Dates | Theme | Release | Focus | Planned Capacity (h) | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|---------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| 1-2 | Oct 1-15 | Critical Stability 🔴 | v2.3.0 | Fix bugs, stable mobile | 80 | ✅ Delivered base stability |
| 3-4 | Oct 16-31 | Quick Value Features 🚀 | v2.4.0 | Dark mode, smart URLs | 80 | In progress / no holidays |
| 5-6 | Nov 1-15 | User Engagement 💎 | v2.5.0 | History, favorites, extension | 80 | Prepare data for retention |
| 7-8 | Nov 16-30 | Performance ⚡ | v2.6.0 | Speed, caching, optimization | 80 | Player pipeline pre-work |
| 9 | Dec 1-15 | Music Player 🎵 | v2.7.0 | Player MVP (core) | 68 | Dev A 5 vacation days (50%) |
| 10 | Dec 16-31 | Polish & Planning 🎁 | v2.8.0 | Quality, docs, Q1 prep | 52 | Dev B 5 vacation days + holidays |

> Capacity note: December staggered vacations (Dev A: first half 5 workdays off, Dev B: second half 5 workdays off) reduce effective capacity ~20% in Sprint 9 and ~35% in Sprint 10.

> Holiday planning: All capacity assumptions must explicitly account for Colombian public holidays (see "Colombia Q4 2025 Public Holidays" section). Effective delivery focus should not exceed 85–90% of theoretical hours in holiday-impacted sprints.

## 👥 Resource & Capacity Notes

| Resource | Oct | Nov | Dec 1-15 | Dec 16-31 | Vacation Pattern |
|----------|-----|-----|----------|-----------|------------------|
| Dev A | 100% | 100% | 50% (5d off) | 100% | First half December off |
| Dev B | 100% | 100% | 100% | 60% (5d off + holidays) | Second half December off |

## 🇨🇴 Colombia Q4 2025 Public Holidays (Impact)

| Date | Holiday | Falls In | Sprint Affected | Impact (est.) |
|------|---------|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Oct 6 (Mon) | Día de la Raza (moved) | Oct 1-15 | Sprint 1-2 | Historical (already delivered) |
| Nov 3 (Mon) | All Saints' Day (moved) | Nov 1-15 | Sprint 5-6 | -1 working day (~5%) |
| Nov 17 (Mon) | Cartagena Independence (moved) | Nov 16-30 | Sprint 7-8 | -1 working day (~5%) |
| Dec 8 (Mon) | Immaculate Conception | Dec 1-15 | Sprint 9 | -1 working day (~6% of adjusted) |
| Dec 25 (Thu) | Christmas Day | Dec 16-31 | Sprint 10 | -1 working day (~7% of adjusted) |

Optional culturally observed half-days (Dec 24 PM, Dec 31 PM) are NOT included above; if enforced, reduce available focus hours a further ~5–8% in Sprint 10.

### Capacity Clarifications
| Sprint | Planned (h) | Holidays Deduction | Vacation Deduction | Effective Focus (h) | Notes |
|--------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------|
| 5-6 | 80 | -4 | 0 | ~76 | Adjust backlog to avoid overcommit |
| 7-8 | 80 | -4 | 0 | ~76 | Keep perf tasks modular |
| 9 | 68 | -4 (Dec 8) | -12 (Dev A) | ~52 | Prioritize core playback first |
| 10 | 52 | -4 (Dec 25) | -12 (Dev B + overhead) | ~36 | Front-load monitoring + cross-browser |

> The Player roadmap should treat any scope beyond "Core Player" as stretch once effective focus <55h (Sprint 9) and <40h (Sprint 10).

### Planning Guidelines
- Always subtract confirmed holidays before assigning story points / hours.
- Treat vacation + holiday overlap as non-recuperable (no evening catch-up assumptions).
- Mark holiday-adjusted capacity in ClickUp sprint description.
- Flag any sprint forecast >90% utilization as high-risk during planning.
- Use feature flags for player sub-features (seek, shortcuts, persistence) to allow partial release safely.

Policy: Alternate vacations to maintain continuity and avoid blocking the Player initiative.

Mitigations:
- Critical player PRs reviewed before time off
- Incremental technical documentation (avoid large end-of-quarter dump)
- Feature flags to enable/disable player safely without heavy rollback

---

> Language Policy: All future documentation updates must be written in English to maintain consistency across contributors.

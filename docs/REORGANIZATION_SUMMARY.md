## 🎯 Key Principle: ZERO TASK ELIMINATION

✅ **ALL tasks are preserved** - Nothing was deleted  
✅ **Prioritization only** - Notion backlog moved to Sprint 3-4 first  
✅ **Original features kept** - Dark mode, smart URLs still included  
✅ **Overflow moved safely** - Moved to Sprint 5-6, not discarded  
✅ **Capacity realistic** - Holidays and vacation factored in

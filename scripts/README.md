## Creating New Scripts

When adding new scripts to this directory:

1. **Make it executable**: `chmod +x scripts/your-script.sh`
2. **Add a comment header** explaining the script's purpose
3. **Document it in this README**
4. **Use descriptive names** that clearly indicate the script's function
5. **Add error handling** with `set -e` for bash scripts
6. **Include usage examples** in comments

### Example Script Template

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# üéØ Script Name and Purpose
# This script does X, Y, and Z
# Usage: ./scripts/your-script.sh [options]

set -e  # Exit on error

echo "Starting script..."

# Your script logic here

echo "‚úÖ Script completed successfully!"
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep scripts simple**: One script, one purpose
- **Add descriptive output**: Use emojis and clear messages
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Check for prerequisites
- **Make scripts idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Document dependencies**: List required tools/env vars
- **Test thoroughly**: Test on fresh environments
